## Essential Next.js Pages Included

Your generated app now includes all essential Next.js pages for a production-ready application:

- **`app/not-found.tsx`** - Custom 404 page with shadcn/ui styling
- **`app/error.tsx`** - Global error boundary with retry functionality
- **`app/loading.tsx`** - Loading states with skeleton components

- **`app/robots.ts`** - Search engine configuration

These pages provide:
- Better user experience for broken links and errors
- Professional loading states
- SEO optimization out of the box
- Production-ready error handling

## Next.js 16 Features

- âš¡ **Turbopack**: Next-generation bundler for faster builds
- ðŸ”§ **Biome**: Unified toolchain for linting and formatting
- ðŸŽ¯ **Improved Performance**: Enhanced React 19 support
- ðŸ“± **Better DX**: Enhanced developer experience
- ðŸ”„ **Proxy Middleware**: New middleware convention replacing old middleware

## Proxy Middleware (Next.js 16)

Your generated app includes a `proxy.ts` file that implements the new Next.js 16 proxy middleware convention. This replaces the old `middleware` naming and provides enhanced functionality.

### What's Included:

- **Basic Proxy**: Redirects `/old-path` to `/new-path`
- **Custom Headers**: Adds `x-custom-header` to all responses
- **Smart Matcher**: Configures which paths the proxy runs on

### Available Examples:

1. **Authentication Proxy** (`examples/proxy-auth.ts`)
   - Protects routes based on session cookies
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login

2. **Internationalization Proxy** (`examples/proxy-i18n.ts`)
   - Detects user locale from headers/cookies
   - Redirects to localized URLs

3. **A/B Testing Proxy** (`examples/proxy-ab-testing.ts`)
   - Assigns users to test variants
   - Rewrites URLs for different experiences

4. **Rate Limiting Proxy** (`examples/proxy-rate-limit.ts`)
   - Implements API rate limiting
   - Protects against abuse

### Key Changes from Middleware:

- File name: `middleware.ts` â†’ `proxy.ts`
- Function name: `middleware()` â†’ `proxy()`
- Enhanced TypeScript support
- Better runtime configuration

## Example

```bash
npx @geobasinas/create-geo-app my-awesome-app
```

This will create a fully configured Next.js 16 application ready for development!

## Performance Optimizations

Your generated app includes comprehensive performance optimizations:

- **Webpack Memory Optimizations**: Reduced memory usage during builds
